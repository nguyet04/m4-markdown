# Exercise-2

As described in [chapter-5](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-git-and-github.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

In the space below, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor.

See `complete` branch for answers.

| Course Number | Course Title | Instructor |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **COURSE1**| _Course 1 title_	| Instructor 1 |
| **COURSE2**| _Course 2 title_	| Instructor 2 |
| **COURSE3**| _Course 3 title_	| Instructor 3 |
